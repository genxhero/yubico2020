# Creative Web

This one is fun! Please include all the solutions you can possibly imagine to the following, in a Markdown file called `solutions.md`.

> What is the most creative way you can get a circle to appear on the screen of a web browser?

Additionally, please implement your favourite solution. Include a run script (`run.sh`) which we can run to test your solution. This script should do any necessary building and compilation, and print either an address or a file we can open in a web browser running on the same machine.
