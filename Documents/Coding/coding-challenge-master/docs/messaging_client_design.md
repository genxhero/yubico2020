# Messaging Client (Design)

We wish to design the frontend described the platform described in the [messaging architecture](messaging_architecture.md) spec.

Please design mockups that demonstrate how someone might build the coordinator-facing interfaces for our messaging product. The same basic requirements from the previous section apply.

If you have time, feel free to add creative extensions, such as addressing how to intuitively allow the coordinator to express intent ("I want to remind the patient to take their medication") or delivery restrictions ("only deliver this message during daylight hours").
